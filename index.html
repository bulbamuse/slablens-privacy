      <h1>SlabLens Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 31, 2025</p>

      <p>
        This SlabLens Privacy Policy describes how SlabLens ("SlabLens," "we,"
        or "us") collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes information
        about you. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when
        you access or use our Chrome browser extension and related services
        (collectively, our "Services") and when you otherwise interact with us,
        such as through our customer support channels.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes,
        we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy. If we
        make material changes, we may provide you with additional notice. We
        encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed
        about our information practices and the choices available to you.
      </p>

      <h2 id="collection">Collection of Information</h2>
      <p>
        The information we collect about you depends on how you interact with
        our Services. In this section, we describe the categories of information
        we collect and the sources of this information.
      </p>

      <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
      <p>
        We automatically collect the following information when you use our
        Services:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Web History:</strong> When you use SlabLens to analyze a
          trading card listing, we collect the URL of the listing
          page you are viewing, the card title from that listing, and the
          timestamp of when you performed the analysis. This information is
          stored on our servers to prevent duplicate analyses of the same
          listing and to provide you with usage statistics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Website Content:</strong> We collect card images, titles, and
          prices from listing pages when you click the SlabLens extension
          icon to analyze a card. These images and data are sent to our backend
          service and to a third-party AI service for automated condition analysis. Card
          images may be temporarily stored on our servers during the analysis
          process.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Anonymous User Identifier:</strong> We generate and store a
          unique anonymous identifier locally on your device using local browser
          storage. This identifier is sent to our backend service to track
          your usage count and enforce daily usage limits. This identifier does
          not contain any personally identifiable information and cannot be used
          to identify you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage Statistics:</strong> We collect information about your
          usage of SlabLens, including the number of analyses you have
          performed, the dates and times of those analyses, and your daily usage
          patterns over the past 7 days. This data is stored on our servers in
          association with your anonymous identifier.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analysis Results:</strong> We store the results of each card
          grading analysis, including the grade (1-10 scale), confidence level,
          and detailed condition assessment. This data is stored in association
          with the listing URL and your anonymous identifier.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
      <p>SlabLens does not collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your name, email address, phone number, or other personally
          identifiable information
        </li>
        <li>Payment or financial information</li>
        <li>Authentication credentials or passwords</li>
        <li>Location data, IP addresses, or GPS coordinates</li>
        <li>Personal communications such as emails, texts, or chat messages</li>
        <li>
          Browsing history outside of trading card listings you choose to
          analyze
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="use">Use of Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Provide, maintain, and improve our AI-powered card grading service
        </li>
        <li>
          Analyze card condition and generate grading results using AI
          technology
        </li>
        <li>
          Cache analysis results to avoid re-analyzing the same listings
        </li>
        <li>Track and enforce daily usage limits</li>
        <li>Provide you with usage statistics and analysis history</li>
        <li>
          Monitor and analyze trends and usage patterns to improve our Services
        </li>
        <li>
          Detect, investigate, and help protect against security incidents and
          fraudulent activity
        </li>
        <li>Comply with our legal and financial obligations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="disclosure">Disclosure of Information</h2>
      <p>
        We share your information with third parties in the following
        circumstances:
      </p>

      <h3>Service Providers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>AI Service Provider:</strong> We send card images extracted from
          listings to a third-party AI service for automated condition analysis. This
          service processes images according to their privacy policy and terms
          of service. We do not send any personally identifiable information to
          this provider.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cloud Database Service:</strong> We use a third-party cloud database
          service to store anonymous user identifiers, usage statistics,
          analysis results, and listing URLs. This service acts as our data
          processor and handles this information in accordance with their
          privacy policy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Affiliate Partners</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>eBay Affiliate Program:</strong> When you open SlabLens on a
          listing page, we automatically redirect you to an affiliate
          version of that listing URL. This redirect includes your anonymous
          identifier as a custom tracking parameter. If you make a purchase on
          eBay after this redirect, eBay may share transaction information with
          us through their affiliate program, and we may earn a commission. See
          the <a href="#affiliate">Affiliate Links and Revenue</a>
          section below for more details.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We may disclose information in response to a request for information
          if we believe that disclosure is in accordance with, or required by,
          any applicable law, regulation, or legal process.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may disclose information if we believe it is necessary to protect
          the rights, property, and safety of SlabLens, our users, or others.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
      <p>
        We may disclose or transfer information in connection with a merger,
        sale of assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our
        business by another company.
      </p>

      <h3>Aggregated or De-Identified Information</h3>
      <p>
        We may use and share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot
        reasonably be used to identify you for research, analytics, or other
        purposes.
      </p>

      <h2 id="affiliate">Affiliate Links and Revenue</h2>

      <p>
        When you open the SlabLens extension popup on a listing page, we
        automatically redirect you to an affiliate version of that listing URL
        through an eBay affiliate program. This happens before you interact with
        the extension and does not require any action on your part.
      </p>

      <p>
        The affiliate URL includes tracking parameters that identify the click
        as coming from SlabLens, as well as your anonymous user identifier. If
        you make a purchase on eBay after this redirect, we may earn a
        commission from eBay. This commission helps us keep SlabLens free to
        use.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What this means for you:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The price you pay on eBay is not affected by our affiliate links
        </li>
        <li>You are not charged any additional fees for using SlabLens</li>
        <li>eBay pays us the commission, not you</li>
        <li>
          Your anonymous identifier may be shared with eBay through the
          affiliate link
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="retention">Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain your anonymous identifier and usage data for as long as you
        continue to use SlabLens. Card images are temporarily stored during the
        analysis process and may be retained for caching purposes to improve
        performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Analysis results (grades, condition assessments) and listing URLs
        are retained indefinitely to provide you with analysis history and to
        prevent duplicate analyses of the same listings.
      </p>

      <h2 id="choices">Your Choices</h2>

      <h3>Uninstalling the Extension</h3>
      <p>
        You can stop all data collection by uninstalling the SlabLens extension
        from your browser. To uninstall, go to your browser's extensions
        management page, find SlabLens, and click "Remove."
      </p>

      <h3>Clearing Local Data</h3>
      <p>
        Your anonymous identifier is stored locally on your device using
        local browser storage. Uninstalling the extension will clear this local
        data. Note that analysis results and usage statistics stored on our
        servers will remain unless you contact us to request deletion.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Deletion Requests</h3>
      <p>
        If you would like us to delete your analysis history and usage data from
        our servers, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:bulba.lomuse@gmail.com">bulba.lomuse@gmail.com</a> with
        your anonymous user identifier (you can find this in the extension
        settings or usage statistics view).
      </p>

      <h3>Opting Out of Affiliate Links</h3>
      <p>
        The automatic affiliate link redirect is a core part of SlabLens's
        revenue model and cannot currently be disabled while using the
        extension. If you do not wish to use affiliate links, you will need to
        uninstall SlabLens.
      </p>

      <h2 id="security">Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from
        loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and
        destruction. However, no internet or electronic storage system is 100%
        secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2 id="contact">Contact Us</h2>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our privacy
        practices, please contact us at:

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material
        changes, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of this
        policy and may provide additional notice through the extension or other
        means. Your continued use of SlabLens after any changes indicates your
        acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
