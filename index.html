      <h1>SlabLens Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 3, 2026</p>

      <p>
        This SlabLens Privacy Policy describes how SlabLens ("SlabLens," "we,"
        or "us") collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes information
        about you. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when
        you access or use our Chrome browser extension and related services
        (collectively, our "Services") and when you otherwise interact with us,
        such as through our customer support channels.
      </p>

      <p>
        To use SlabLens, you must create an account by signing in with a third-party authentication provider. We collect certain account information as described below.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes,
        we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy. If we
        make material changes, we may provide you with additional notice. We
        encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed
        about our information practices and the choices available to you.
      </p>

      <h2 id="collection">Collection of Information</h2>
      <p>
        The information we collect about you depends on how you interact with
        our Services. In this section, we describe the categories of information
        we collect and the sources of this information.
      </p>

      <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
      <p>
        We collect information you provide directly to us when you create an account and use our Services:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account Information:</strong> To use SlabLens, you must create an account by signing in with a third-party authentication provider. When you sign in, we receive your email address, full name, and profile picture.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Community Grade Submissions:</strong> When you submit your own grade assessment (1-10 scale) for a trading card listing, we collect and store your submitted grade along with the listing information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Communications:</strong> Any information you provide when contacting our customer support or communicating with us.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
      <p>
        We automatically collect the following information when you use our
        Services:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Web History:</strong> When you use SlabLens to analyze a
          trading card listing, we collect the URL of the listing
          page you are viewing, the card title from that listing, and the
          timestamp of when you performed the analysis. This information is
          stored on our servers to prevent duplicate analyses of the same
          listing and to provide you with usage statistics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Website Content:</strong> We collect card images, titles, and
          prices from listing pages when you click the SlabLens extension
          icon to analyze a card. These images and data are sent to our backend
          service and to a third-party AI service for automated condition analysis. Card
          images may be temporarily stored on our servers during the analysis
          process.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User Account Information:</strong> When you sign in, we create a unique user account ID that links all your activity within SlabLens. All analyses, grade submissions, and usage data are associated with your user account. Session authentication tokens are stored locally in your browser's Chrome storage to keep you signed in.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage Statistics:</strong> We collect information about your
          usage of SlabLens, including the number of analyses you have
          performed, the dates and times of those analyses, and your daily usage
          patterns over the past 7 days. This data is stored on our servers in
          association with your user account.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analysis Results:</strong> We store the results of each card
          grading analysis, including the grade (1-10 scale), confidence level,
          and detailed condition assessment. This data is stored in association
          with the listing URL and your user account.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Information We Collect from Other Sources</h3>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Authentication Provider:</strong> When you sign in, we receive your email address, full name, and profile picture from your authentication provider in accordance with their authorization procedures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trading Card Listing Pages:</strong> When you use SlabLens to analyze a card, we collect card images, titles, and prices from the listing page you are viewing.

        <li>
          Browsing history outside of trading card listings you choose to

      </ul>

        We share your information with third parties in the following
        circumstances:
      </p>

      <h3>Service Providers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>AI Service Provider:</strong> We send card images, titles, and prices extracted from listings to a third-party AI service for automated condition analysis and grading. We do not send any account information (email, name, or avatar) to this provider. This service processes data according to their privacy policy and terms of service.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cloud Database and Authentication Service:</strong> We use a third-party cloud service to store user account information (email, name, avatar), user IDs, usage statistics, analysis results, grade submissions, and listing URLs. This service also provides our authentication infrastructure. This service acts as our data processor and handles information in accordance with their privacy policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Authentication Provider:</strong> We use a third-party authentication service for user sign-in. When you sign in, this service provides us with your email address, full name, and profile picture from your account in accordance with their authorization procedures.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Affiliate Partners</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Affiliate Program:</strong> When you open SlabLens on a
          listing page, we automatically redirect you to an affiliate
          version of that listing URL. This redirect includes your user account
          identifier as a custom tracking parameter. If you make a purchase
          after this redirect, the merchant may share transaction information with
          us through their affiliate program, and we may earn a commission. See
          the <a href="#affiliate">Affiliate Links and Revenue</a>
          section below for more details.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We may disclose information in response to a request for information
          if we believe that disclosure is in accordance with, or required by,
          any applicable law, regulation, or legal process.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may disclose information if we believe it is necessary to protect
          the rights, property, and safety of SlabLens, our users, or others.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
      <p>
        We may disclose or transfer information in connection with a merger,
        sale of assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our
        business by another company.
      </p>

      <h3>Aggregated or De-Identified Information</h3>
      <p>
        We may use and share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot
        reasonably be used to identify you for research, analytics, or other
        purposes.
      </p>

      <h2 id="affiliate">Affiliate Links and Revenue</h2>

      <p>
        When you open the SlabLens extension popup on a listing page, we
        automatically redirect you to an affiliate version of that listing URL.
        This happens before you interact with the extension and does not require
        any action on your part.
      </p>

      <p>
        The affiliate URL includes tracking parameters that identify the click
        as coming from SlabLens, as well as your user account identifier. If
        you make a purchase after this redirect, we may earn a commission. This
        commission helps us keep SlabLens free to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What this means for you:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The price you pay is not affected by our affiliate links</li>
        <li>You are not charged any additional fees for using SlabLens</li>
        <li>The merchant pays us the commission, not you</li>
        <li>
          Your user account identifier may be shared through the affiliate link
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="retention">Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain your user account information (email, name, avatar) and usage data for as long as you
        continue to use SlabLens, or until you request account deletion. Card images are temporarily stored during the
        analysis process and may be retained for caching purposes to improve
        performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Analysis results (grades, condition assessments) and listing URLs
        are retained indefinitely to provide you with analysis history and to
        prevent duplicate analyses of the same listings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Community grade submissions are retained indefinitely as public community data to provide aggregate statistics to all users.
      </p>

      <p>
        Session authentication tokens are stored locally in your browser and are cleared when you sign out.
      </p>

      <h2 id="choices">Your Choices</h2>

      <h3>Account Information</h3>
      <p>
        You can view your account information (name, email, avatar) within the SlabLens extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        To delete your account and associated data, please email us at <a href="mailto:bulba.lomuse@gmail.com">bulba.lomuse@gmail.com</a>. Note that community grade submissions may be retained as aggregated statistics even after account deletion.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can sign out at any time within the extension, which clears your local session tokens.
      </p>

      <h3>Uninstalling the Extension</h3>
      <p>
        You can stop all data collection by uninstalling the SlabLens extension
        from your browser. To uninstall, go to your browser's extensions
        management page, find SlabLens, and click "Remove."
      </p>

      <h3>Clearing Local Data</h3>
      <p>
        Your session tokens and account data are stored locally on your device using
        Chrome's local storage. Uninstalling the extension or signing out will clear this local
        data.
      </p>

      <h3>Opting Out of Affiliate Links</h3>
      <p>
        The automatic affiliate link redirect is a core part of SlabLens's
        revenue model and cannot currently be disabled while using the
        extension. If you do not wish to use affiliate links, you will need to
        uninstall SlabLens.
      </p>

      <h2 id="security">Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from
        loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and
        destruction. However, no internet or electronic storage system is 100%
        secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

        practices, please contact us at:

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material
        changes, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of this
        policy and may provide additional notice through the extension or other
        means. Your continued use of SlabLens after any changes indicates your
        acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
