        <p>
            This SlabLens Privacy Policy describes how SlabLens ("SlabLens," "we," or "us") collects, uses,
            discloses, and otherwise processes information about you. This Privacy Policy applies to information
            we collect when you access or use our Chrome browser extension and related services (collectively,
            our "Services") and when you otherwise interact with us, such as through our customer support channels.
        </p>

        <p>
            We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by
            revising the date at the top of this policy. If we make material changes, we may provide you with
            additional notice. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about
            our information practices and the choices available to you.

        <h2 id="collection">Collection of Information</h2>
        <p>
            The information we collect about you depends on how you interact with our Services.
            In this section, we describe the categories of information we collect and the sources of this information.
        </p>

        <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
        <p>We automatically collect the following information when you use our Services:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Web History:</strong> When you use SlabLens to analyze a trading card listing on eBay,
                we collect the URL of the eBay listing page you are viewing, the card title from that listing,
                and the timestamp of when you performed the analysis. This information is stored on our servers
                to prevent duplicate analyses of the same listing and to provide you with usage statistics.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Website Content:</strong> We collect card images, titles, and prices from eBay listing
                pages when you click the SlabLens extension icon to analyze a card. These images and data are
                sent to our backend service and to OpenAI's API for AI-powered condition analysis. Card images
                may be temporarily stored on our servers during the analysis process.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Anonymous User Identifier:</strong> We generate and store a unique anonymous identifier
                locally on your device (using Chrome's storage API). This identifier is sent to our backend
                service to track your usage count and enforce daily usage limits. This identifier does not
                contain any personally identifiable information and cannot be used to identify you.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Usage Statistics:</strong> We collect information about your usage of SlabLens, including
                the number of analyses you have performed, the dates and times of those analyses, and your daily
                usage patterns over the past 7 days. This data is stored on our servers in association with your
                anonymous identifier.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Analysis Results:</strong> We store the results of each card grading analysis, including
                the grade (1-10 scale), confidence level, and detailed condition assessment. This data is stored
                in association with the eBay listing URL and your anonymous identifier.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
        <p>SlabLens does not collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name, email address, phone number, or other personally identifiable information</li>
            <li>Payment or financial information</li>
            <li>Authentication credentials or passwords</li>
            <li>Location data, IP addresses, or GPS coordinates</li>
            <li>Personal communications such as emails, texts, or chat messages</li>
            <li>Browsing history outside of eBay trading card listings you choose to analyze</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="use">Use of Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our AI-powered card grading service</li>
            <li>Analyze card condition and generate grading results using AI technology</li>
            <li>Cache analysis results to avoid re-analyzing the same eBay listings</li>
            <li>Track and enforce daily usage limits</li>
            <li>Provide you with usage statistics and analysis history</li>
            <li>Monitor and analyze trends and usage patterns to improve our Services</li>
            <li>Detect, investigate, and help protect against security incidents and fraudulent activity</li>
            <li>Comply with our legal and financial obligations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="disclosure">Disclosure of Information</h2>
        <p>We share your information with third parties in the following circumstances:</p>

        <h3>Service Providers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>OpenAI:</strong> We send card images extracted from eBay listings to OpenAI's API
                for AI-powered condition analysis. OpenAI processes these images according to their privacy
                policy and API terms of service. We do not send any personally identifiable information to OpenAI.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Supabase:</strong> We use Supabase as our backend database service to store anonymous
                user identifiers, usage statistics, analysis results, and eBay listing URLs. Supabase acts as
                our data processor and handles this information in accordance with their privacy policy.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>eBay and Affiliate Partners</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>eBay Partner Network:</strong> When you open SlabLens on an eBay listing page, we
                automatically redirect you to an affiliate version of that listing URL. This redirect includes
                your anonymous identifier as a custom tracking parameter. If you make a purchase on eBay after
                this redirect, eBay may share transaction information with us through the eBay Partner Network,
                and we may earn a commission. See the <a href="#affiliate">Affiliate Links and Revenue</a>
                section below for more details.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We may disclose information in response to a request for information if we believe that disclosure
                is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, or legal process.
            </li>
            <li>
                We may disclose information if we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, and
                safety of SlabLens, our users, or others.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
        <p>
            We may disclose or transfer information in connection with a merger, sale of assets, financing,
            or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.
        </p>

        <h3>Aggregated or De-Identified Information</h3>
        <p>
            We may use and share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to
            identify you for research, analytics, or other purposes.
        </p>

        <h2 id="affiliate">Affiliate Links and Revenue</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Important Notice:</strong> SlabLens uses affiliate links to generate revenue.
        </div>

        <p>
            When you open the SlabLens extension popup on an eBay listing page, we automatically redirect
            you to an affiliate version of that listing URL through the eBay Partner Network. This happens
            before you interact with the extension and does not require any action on your part.
        </p>

        <p>
            The affiliate URL includes tracking parameters that identify the click as coming from SlabLens,
            as well as your anonymous user identifier. If you make a purchase on eBay after this redirect,
            we may earn a commission from eBay. This commission helps us keep SlabLens free to use.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>What this means for you:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The price you pay on eBay is not affected by our affiliate links</li>
            <li>You are not charged any additional fees for using SlabLens</li>
            <li>eBay pays us the commission, not you</li>
            <li>Your anonymous identifier may be shared with eBay through the affiliate link</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="retention">Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            We retain your anonymous identifier and usage data for as long as you continue to use SlabLens.
            Card images are temporarily stored during the analysis process and may be retained for caching
            purposes to improve performance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Analysis results (grades, condition assessments) and eBay listing URLs are retained indefinitely
            to provide you with analysis history and to prevent duplicate analyses of the same listings.
        </p>

        <h2 id="choices">Your Choices</h2>

        <h3>Uninstalling the Extension</h3>
        <p>
            You can stop all data collection by uninstalling the SlabLens extension from your browser.
            To uninstall, go to your Chrome extensions page (chrome://extensions/), find SlabLens, and
            click "Remove."
        </p>

        <h3>Clearing Local Data</h3>
        <p>
            Your anonymous identifier is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API.
            Uninstalling the extension will clear this local data. Note that analysis results and usage
            statistics stored on our servers will remain unless you contact us to request deletion.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Deletion Requests</h3>
        <p>
            If you would like us to delete your analysis history and usage data from our servers, please
            contact us at <a href="mailto:bulba.lomuse@gmail.com">bulba.lomuse@gmail.com</a> with your
            anonymous user identifier (you can find this in the extension settings or usage statistics view).
        </p>

        <h3>Opting Out of Affiliate Links</h3>
        <p>
            The automatic affiliate link redirect is a core part of SlabLens's revenue model and cannot
            currently be disabled while using the extension. If you do not wish to use affiliate links,
            you will need to uninstall SlabLens.
        </p>

        <h2 id="security">Security</h2>
        <p>
            We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse,
            unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no internet or electronic
            storage system is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            SlabLens is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly
            collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected
            information from a child under 13, we will delete that information.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will
            notify you by updating the date at the top of this policy and may provide additional notice
            through the extension or other means. Your continued use of SlabLens after any changes indicates
            your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
